# Flexure Compensation System (FCS):
"Flexure correction will be implemented using a look up table based on telescope elevation and instrument rotator angle."
--> previous experience with siilar Cassegrain instruments (Kibrick+2000,2003) showed a 10:1 reduction in image motion

MOSFIRE has a similar custom piezo tip/tilt platform version to that of NIRES.
Refer to "prelim_design_FCS_final_PDR.png" figure.

Essentially, the tip/tilt plaform consists of three low-voltage piezoelectric linear drives which support the load plate in a tripod fashion.

### MOSFIRE hardware server for FCS: MFCS

## Mechanism Server-Telescope:
"Instances of `watch_keywords` will be used by the MOSFIRE Flexure Compensation and Pupil Rotator servers to coordinate their movements."
