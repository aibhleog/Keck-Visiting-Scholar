# Keck Visiting Scholar work
_*MOSFIRE upgrades & added features*_
This is a repository for MOSFIRE code related to my Keck Visiting Scholar (KVS) work with Dr. Josh Walawender.  In general, this repository focuses on the following items:

- updating & standardizing my automated seeing map for use in MOSFIRE GUI
- creating a drift-tracking code for MOSFIRE
- updated flexure models for MOSFIRE

NOTE: There is a private subrepo in this repository called KVS-data. If this repo is cloned, you will have a folder for this repo but nothing will be inside as it's a private repository and needs confirmation for access.

>_Side note:_
>I've noticed that the dpi default setting I have doesn't work when I run my scripts that make PNGs in Jupyter Lab (which is where I do most of my coding) -- so if you have set your dpi in your matplotlibrc or style sheet, consider running the scripts that make PNG files in an iPython terminal instead.
